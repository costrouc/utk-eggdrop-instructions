competition is on the 4th floor.</p>

<h1><a name="roles"></a>Roles</h1>
<p>Below are listed the bare minimum number of roles (5) but running
the competition will be stressful if you have less than 6 people. You
will want to aim for <strong>10 volunteers</strong>. Seriously the
more the better. It is easier for everyone.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="general---photographerquestionsforms"></a>
General - (Photographer/Questions/Forms)</h2>
<p>The more people (2-3) with this role the better.</p>
<p>Make sure that students are forming the two lines show in the
layout picture above. The first line should end at the table and go
outside of the min kao building along the sidewalk. Make sure that
the students are only taking up one side of the entrance (we have had
complaints before). the second line should end at the egg drop
station and wrap around the railing single file (so that people can
still pass by) see figure above for path.</p>
<p>This is a role that is a mix because each role in its self does
not take all your time. Your role is to hand out forms to students in
line for the part counting and part weighing so that they can start
filling out the form before getting to the table. Additionally please
help answer any questions that people will have. Also please take
pictures of the event so that MRS has something to show!</p>
<h1><a name="form-score-updater"></a>Form Score Updater</h1>
<p>This will require a person 30 minutes after the competition starts
and onwards. The score updating is the person who will take completed
contraption forms and add the information to the excel spreadsheet
(hopefully google doc so it can be realtime for the students). All
completed contraption sheets will be returned to the table where
parts are weighed and counted if the student want to be scored.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="part-counter"></a>Part Counter</h2>
<p>The part counter will count the number of parts each students
contraption contains. A general rule of thumb is be nice and be
consistent. Any contraption with more than 4 parts is pretty much
guaranteed to lose the competition. For example count 5 pieces of
tape as one, count 8 straws as 1 or 2 straws. You will be the first
table to students go to. You will inevitably have to tell students to
fill out a form but hopefully the question/form people can help!</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="part-weigher"></a>Part Weigher</h2>
<p>The part weigher uses the scale to weight contraptions in grams.
Make sure to tare the scale. You will be at the same table as the
part counter.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="drop-zone-inspector-egg-inspector"></a>Drop
Zone Inspector (Egg Inspector)</h2>
<p>This person is responsible for being at the dropzone and opening
up contraptions to check if the egg cracked. You must also ensure
that the dropzone is safe and that no students walk underneeth the
dropzone. This is the messiest job but is also a lot of fun.</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="drop-zone-conductor"></a>Drop Zone
Conductor</h2>
<p>Typically the role that will require two people because you will
have several responsibilities. You are the person responsible for:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">ensuring that each contraption
	has an egg before dropping 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">telling the student when it is
	safe to drop the contraption 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p>filling out their contraption form with (survived and drop
	zone) 
	</p>
</ul>
<p>This role works best with one person ensuring that each person's
contraption in line has an egg.</p>
