Below is a collection of advice from previous egg drop competitions
that utk has hosted. This can be thought of as a log of how the
competition went each year.

# 2017 Advice

Serious:
 - no pvc (it will explode)

Don't belive a need to act on:
 - no wrapping the egg before the drop (increases time between drops)
 - make sure contraptions have egg inside (probably a joke)

# 2016 prior

 - do not allow liquid of any kind
 - no food in contraption
 - nothing that could break the floor
