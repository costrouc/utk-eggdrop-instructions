# MSE Egg Drop Contest Rules

1. The competition is sponsored by the Department of Materials Science
   and Engineering and the Materials Research Society with the intent
   that th e entries focus on materials selection. The objective is to
   design a device with a fo cuson the materials used that will
   protect a “free range” grade A egg from breaking when dropped.
2. The score will be calculated using the following equation. The
   lowest nonzero score wins. As can be seen from the equation below
   the goal is to design a device with the lightest weight, the fewest
   number of parts, and the most accurate drop to the Drop Zone
   target.

$$ score = \left[ \frac{30}{31} W + \frac{30}{18} N + 20 DZ \right] EIF $$

----  -------------------------------------------------------
W     Weight in grams
N     Number of parts
DZ    Drop Zone
EIF   Egg Integrity Factor (1 is not cracked or 0 if cracked)
----  -------------------------------------------------------

3. Eggs will be provided on the day of the contest
4. Each device will be weighed at the contest with no egg inside
5. The number of parts used for the device will be counted on the day
   of the contest. Each individual structural component will generally
   count as one piece, and the official number of parts will be
   decided by a judge at the contest.
6. The Drop Zone will be comprised of three concentric rings: two,
   four, and six feet in diameter. A land entirely within the
   innermost ring will be one point, in the second ring will be two
   points, in the third ring will be three points, and outside of all
   the rings will be four points. The device will receive points based
   on the outmost ring in which any part of the device lies.

7. **Materials which are not allowed in construction include gases
   (other than air), gels, pastes, liquids, any food item, overly
   messy materials, pvc pipe, and any potentially dangerous
   materials.** A judge will decide if any questionable devices are
   allowed to drop. Examples of restricted materials include peanut
   butter, rice, shaving cream, and helium. Please be mindful of those
   cleaning up after the event.
8. First, second, and third places will be announced on the Engineer’s
   Day website following the event
9. The entire device must be above the drop plane (even with the top
   of the railing) when released. It cannot be in contact with the
   ground, a person, or a structure. For example, a long slide may not
   be used to transport the egg from the balcony to the ground.
10. Safety is a high priority, so anyone dropping their device before
    the drop zone is clear and their O.K. is given will be
    disqualified.
11. Anyone or Team may enter multiple devices as long as each design
    is unique.
12. Up to three modified drops will be allowed, if time permits.
13. A judge will determine if each entrant follows all contest rules
14. Drop height is approximately 32 ft.
15. Score sheets must be returned to the registration desk after the
    drop. Failure to return the sheet prevents scoring, and so the
    team cannot be ranked.
